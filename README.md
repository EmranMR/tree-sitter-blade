### ‚ö†Ô∏èv0.12.0 Upgrade Guide ‚ú®

- The grammar has been pretty much rewritten from the ground up.
  _tree-sitter-blade_ now inherits `html` and takes control of the `html` tree
  structure as well
- The grammar is way more semantic, leaner and much faster, like lightening fast
  (10x) thanks to the drastically improved performance
- Please read the `v0.12.0`
  [Release Note for the Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/releases/tag/v0.12.0),
  if you have any questions, feel free to start a discussion or raise an issue

## Introduction (feel free to skip)

This project aims to write the tree-sitter grammar for
[Laravel Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/blade#main-content).

This grammar can be used in any editor or service that support
[Tree-Sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter). Such as, but not
limited to:

- **_Neovim_**
- **_Zed_**
- **_Nova_**

Simply use the [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) plugin and install the `blade` grammar.

## Queries

> [!NOTE]
> Your editor or service might use a different **_capture group_** name or
> **_predicates_** than the queries in the `queries/` folder. Consequently, you
> will need to find out how to approach queries or where they are stored and
> used in your editor's documentation. For example **_Nova_** does not use
> anything in this folder and uses its own `Queries` folder instead.

Here's an example of all the various languages that are injected:

And here's an example of folding in action:

## Issues

If something does not look right please raise an
[issue](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade/issues) with a detailed
examples of what you are trying to achieve. Add any of the following if
necessary:

- Code Excerpts (allows me to test)
- Photo of the issue
- Parse Tree (if inspectable by your editor)

If you need help with anything else or would like to share tips and tricks for
your fellow devs, feel free to use the
